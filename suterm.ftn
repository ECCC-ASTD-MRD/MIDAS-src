      SUBROUTINE SUTERM(KULOUT)

#if defined (DOC)
*
***s/rSUTERM  - Termination of Job (close IO/units, deallocate
*     .          memory and verification of the integrity of the heap)
*
*Author: P. Gauthier *ARMA/AES  June 9, 1992
*Revision:
*     P. Gauthier *ARMA/AES May 25, 1993
*     .     Update to take into aacount all the new arrays
*     .     Arrays allocated by SUALLO and SUALOBS are optionally
*     .     deallocated when HPCHECK signals an error.
*     P. Koclas    CMC/CMSV January 1997
*     .     added call to EXFIN
*     L. Fillion *ARMA/AES Nov 25, 1998
*     .     Deallocate arrays needed for TL and ADJ observation operators.
*     C. Charette *ARMA/AES Fev 1999
*     .     Deallocate arrays in compdg.cdk
*     C. Charette *ARMA/AES SEP 1999
*          - Operator PTOT as a function of latitude
*     S. Pellerin *ARMA/SMC May 2000
*          - Logical unit cleanup
*          - Fix for F90 conversion:
*                 .Illimination of pointer to character*9 CSTNID
*                 .Introduction of distinc pointer for integer
*                  and real cma arrays (ptmobhdr,ptrobhdr,ptmobdata
*                  ,ptrobdata)
*     Bin He  *ARMA/SMC DEC. 2006
*          - only keep the release of the memory pointed by PTGD. The remain memory
*          release moved to subroutine "memfree" which is called before varout   
*
*     C.Charette *ARMA/AES  May 23,2007
*          - With respect to version v10.0.2
*            1) Added the deallocation of memory of
*               PTILON, PTCONPHY, PTCONINA
*
*    Bin HE   *ARMA/SMC  - Apr. 2008 
*          - closed multiple trial files.   
*
*Arguments
*     i   KULOUT: unit used for optional printing
