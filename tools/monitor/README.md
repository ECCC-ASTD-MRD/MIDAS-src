## `midas.monitor`

This program contains a loop to check for the content of a file (given as the first argument):
 * if it contains `VAR3D_STATUS=REBM_DONE\n` then execute a script (given as the second argument)
 * if it contains `VAR3D_STATUS=VAR3D_END\n` then exits.

This is used in script `midas.launch` which monitors the content of
the file `VAR3D_STATUS.dot` to launch other task as soon as the
analysis is done prior to the update of BURP files which is done
after.

## UnitTests

You can run the unit tests very easily with the command `./test.sh` or `make test` which should give you an output like this.
