 * Add new variables to varnamelist_mod useful for `midas-ensManip` to compute mean and stddev (HR,TD,PN,PR,I2,I3,I4,I5,I6,I8,DN,FB,FI) (#236 and !240)
 * Implementation of the slant-path radiative transfer for the radiance observations, on background and analysis increment states (#243 and !238).
   * Two new namelists are added: `nams2c` activates the slant-path calculation for background and/or analysis increment states, `namSlantPath` defines the parameters for iterations to resolve the slant line-of-sight.
 * Add first implementation of the Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter in MIDAS (#245 and !233)
 * Add footprint operator (so far only for sea ice obs) for horizontal interpolation from the grid to the observation location (#197 and !222)

   `install_suite.sh` in the maestro test suite.  By default, only the
   links on which the suite will run are created. (#231 and !216)
 * The logical namelist variable `ltopofilt` has been removed. Note: you probably **must update your namelist** (#225 and !211)
   * The new namelist variable is called `list_topoFilt`. This string array variable allow to activate the topographic rejection criteria for selected observation families. See the namelist in the unit tests from examples.

 * Enable `vcode=5005` for ensemble B matrix (#188 and !173)
 * The aladin HLOS wind observations can now be adjusted to compensate for the observations having been calculated at another meteorolgical facility (#139 and !172)

### Changed

 * Update the expected execution timings for the ones on HPCR-U1 (#298 and !291)
   * On XC50, we use `TBB_MALLOC_USE_HUGE_PAGES=1` to save 7% in execution freely.w
   * Some users are notified when a timing outlier is found.
 * The GitLab runner which runs the continuous integration process is now executed under user `sanl888` (#288 and !277)
 * Also using `eccc/mrd/rpn/anl/rttov/12v1.4` which have been compiled
    with `code-tools/01.3` (#275 and !257)
 * The automated (CI) system tests now runs on both available platforms: HPCR-U0 and HPCR-U1 (#270 and !250)
 * The observation variable transforms was generalized and modernized (#247 and !239).
    * Previously only wind (speed,direction) -> (u,v) was supported. Now users can add (relatively) easily any type of variable transform. For now, only visibility -> log(visibility) was added.
    * An observation transform is activated when an assimilated observation is not found in the observations read from burp or sqlite files.
    * On outputs, the o-p and/or o-a of the transformed variables are converted and added to the original/source variable. In the output burp files, only the source variable appears because it was found too difficult to modify `brpr_updateBurp`. However, both source and transformed variable info are written to the sqlite files.
 * The height/pressure are computed on the grid, before horizontal interpolation to observation locations, to prepare for using slanted columns and footprint operators. (#124 and !220)
    * The height/pressure are part of statevector/columndata main data storage arrays (gd_r4/gd_r8/all) and are calculated for the trial fields and the increments.
    * Allocation of height/pressure is set to true, by default, and it is done if the necessary variables for their calculation are available in the statevector/columndata.
    * Z_M/Z_T and P_M/P_T are the height and pressure on grid on the TH and MM levels in `varNameList_mod`.
    * dPdPsfc is no longer used in any observation operators since the increment of pressure is calculated on the grid and is interpolated to the observation location.
    * Change namelist variable `addGZsfcOffset` to `addHeightSfcOffset`.
    * Variable/function/subroutine names that include `gz` are changed to `height` to reflect the fact that geometric altitude/height is now the primary variable instead of geopotential.
    * Memory requirements are higher for some programs and configurations (but not gdps and rdps configurations). 
    * The execution time is also increased for some (e.g. gdps takes ~100 seconds longer, but this can be reduced by increasing number of nodes to 30 or 36).
 * Minor change in `tt2phi_mod` (slightly affects results): now setting near-sfc temperature and momentum altitude levels to their known height offset (#180 and !212).
 * The namelist variable `scaleFactor` in `NAMBHI` must now be specified in all 3DVar configurations because default value was changed from 1.0 to 0.0. (#224 and !209)
 * CalcStats in LAM mode was made MPI compatible (#158 and !202)
 * Replacing the old numerical recipe for generating gaussian random values by a much more efficient method (#82 and !192)
   [`random_tools`](https://gitlab.com/mfvalin/random_tools).
    * This is changing the results only for the program `midas-randomPert`.
 * Changes to the height (GZ) calculation within MIDAS so that GPS-RO and GPS-gb now use same heights as other obs types (#141 and !191)
    * The variable was also changed from geopotential to altitude
    * New namelist variable to allow using static GPS-RO observation error variance
    * Small change to H(x) results due to these modifications for GPS-RO, GPS-gb, GZ and possibly sfc obs
 * When compiling with `COMPILE_MIDAS_ADD_DEBUG_OPTIONS=yes`, the options `-debug -check all -O 0` are added to the compile command (#182 and !187)
 * The body of the program `midas-oMinusF` was extracted into a new module, `ominusf_mod` (#113 and !174)
 * **Major change:** New approach for horizontal/temporal interpolation of background state and increment to observation locations/times (#80 and !147)
    * Changes to how the background state is read; now relies on `gridstatevector_mod`
    * File copy to ramdisk for all files can be done by fortran code (simplifies scripts)
    * Linear time interpolation can be applied to the background state when computing the innovations (controlled by namelist variable, default is nearest neighbour)
    * Small change to results for most applications and some increases in time and memory requirements
 * Use constituent BUFR elements from official tableburp file released 30 Sept 2018 (#150 and !137)
 * The input file trlp is no longer necessary in varbc mode (Slight unsignificant change in the results of varbc) (#145 and !129)

### Fixed

 * Add missing O-P background check for surface (2m) dewpoint depression ES (#294 and !288)
 * Fix bug triggered by GB-GPS reports with missing ZTD in background check of conventional observations (#295 and !287)
 * Correction to the surface humidity (BUFR element 13214) writen in BURP files info block during hyperspectral IR background check. Due to the error introduced in !111 exp(HU) was written instead of HU. (#257 and !247)
 * Fixed bugs, compilation procedure and system tests to allow compatibility on new machines (ppp3/4, banting/daley) - note, only the latest version of the reference results are available on the new machines (#258 and !243)
 * Correction of the conversion factor used to compute air mass predictors in `biascorrection_mod`. Problem introduced in !191. (#219 and !219)
 * Fixed some potential bugs detected while compiling with `-check all` (#182 and !187)
 * Improved efficiency of ensemble amplitude memory access and writing of `rehm` and `anlm` files (#170 and !153)
 * Fix the selection of GPSRO-bending angle observations (#151 and !145)

## [3.4.2]

 * Fixed bugs, compilation procedure and system tests to allow
   compatibility on new machines (ppp3/4, banting/daley) - note, only
   the latest version of the reference results are available on the
   new machines (#234 and !244)
	* This work is aimed to be introduced in a new release branch
	`v_3.4` which origins from `v_3.3.5`.

 * Correction of a bug in the update of cloud parameters and
   emissivity in IR bgcheck mode that was affecting CrIS FSR. (#240 and !223)
 * Adding two files for instrument CrIS FSR for observations inputs in
   case we receive more than 2 satellites.  We already introduced:
    * `obscrisfsr1` and `obscrisfsr2` recently and we add
    * `obscrisfsr3` and `obscrisfsr4`.
 * Bug fix for the BURP cloud parameters and emissivity update bugfix
   above to handle properly missing data cases (#240 and !225)

## [3.3.3]

### Added

 * The analysis increment can now be masked in the blending zone like in the former program `addAnalInc` (#213 and !200)
 * Adding support for CrIS FSR radiances (#205 and !193)
   * It needs a modified version of RTTOV-12.
   * New input files were added to work around the file size limit of
     BURP:
     * `brpcrisfsr`, `brpcrisfsr1`, `brpcrisfsr2`
     * `obscrisfsr`, `obscrisfsr1`, `obscrisfsr2`
 * With GOES-R, it will be ABI instrument instead of `goesimager`.
   The code was modified to account for that. (#211 and !196)

### Removed

   * The module `burpread_mod` now includes the function
     `brpr_getTypeResume` which returns the module private variable
     `TYPE_RESUME`

  of `rehm` and `anlm` files (#170 and !151)

## [3.3.0]:

### Added

* The program `ensManip` can now compute the standard deviation of an
  ensemble of forecasts and recenter the ensemble forecasts around a
  specified mean (#55, #65, #104, #131, !48, !52, !94 and !116).
* The program `ensManip` can now read a file `targetgrid` in the
  working directory on which grid all fields will be interpolated
  (#138 and !128).  By default, all files will be interpolated on the
  grid of the ensemble.
* A program `addIncrement` has been added (#38, #53, #54, #123, #126, !102, !41, !47, !100, !106 and !115)
  * The namelist `NAMADDINC` has been renamed `NAMINC`.  The namelist
    variable `CETIKINC` in namelist `NAMMIN` has been moved to
    `NAMINC` with name `ETIKET_REBM`. The namelist variable

   * This is to be removed when `r.run_in_parallel` will be officially
     released.

  most test for program `midas-var`.
* Reject observations with unrealistic lat-lon values (#137 and !128)

## [3.2.2] - 2018-05-09

No change to the fortran code so it is equivalent to `v_3.2.1`.

## [3.2.1] - 2018-05-03

### Fixed

- Fix a bug when IASI are missing at the background check step.  It
was causing an aborting in the following analysis.  We also correct a
non-initialized variable.  (#94 and #96)

## [3.2.0] - 2018-03-02

This release comes from `v_3.0.4` to ignore changes with `lapack.o` in
RTTOV-12.

### Fixed

- Fix a bug which affects `BURP_update` (#66 and #79)

## [3.1.0] - 2018-01-28

This version will be ignored.

Since the release `v_3.0.5` has changed the results, we should have
tagged it `v_3.1.0` to follow semantic versioning.

## [3.0.5] - 2018-01-12

This version was not implemented in operations.  This release has been
ignored.

### Changed

Using `rttov/12v1.1` which does not contain `lapack.o`.  We want to
use the system librairies.  This does not impact the timings but the
results are very sligthly changed.

## [3.0.4] - 2017-11-28

### Fixed

- Fix a bug where an assumption was incorrectly made that the number
of vertical levels of the trial field was the same as in the analysis
vertical grid.

## [3.0.3] - 2017-11-28

### Fixed

- Fix the situation where the grid for TG is not the same as for other
     fields like TT.  This is the case where the trial field comes
     from a LAM (#45).

## [3.0.2] - 2017-11-16

### Fixed

- Fix MPI related problems in `tvs_rttov_read_coefs` (!39 and #44)

## [3.0.1] - 2017-11-08

### Fixed

- Fix the rare case where all obs on one mpi task are sent to another
mpi task during the redistribution step (!38 and #42)

## [3.0.0] - 2017-10-30

This is the initial version delivered in final cycles for the GDPS 6.1 project in 2018.

### Added
- Includes backward comptatible changes to conventional observations by Stéphane Laroche

### Changed
- Introducing the use of RTTOV-12 library (release `1.0`) (non backward compatible) (Sylvain Heilliette)
- Using `cmda/libs/16.2-6`
- Reduce memory usage for IR bgck by a factor of 5

## [2.2.0] - 2016-09

This is the first version published and use on the HPCR platforms
`ubuntu-14.04-amd64-64` and `sles-11-amd64-64` on the `science.gc.ca`
network.

Some other `v_2.2.*` subsequent versions have been published but we
are not documenting them here.
