Issue #XXX: Title representing the change (should be less then 40 characters)

In the title, specify the related issue number (replacing "XXX").

The body should include more detailed explanatory text, if
necessary. Explain why the change was made. Also, mention if the
results or the timings are affected by this change.  You can also
refer to other issues using the '#' sign.

Wrap it to about 72 characters or so ('git log' does not automatically
wrap text).  The blank line separating the summary from the body is
critical (unless you omit the body entirely). Separate paragraphs with
blank lines.

- Bullet points are okay, too

- Use a hyphen followed by a single space, with blank lines in between
  and use a hanging indent
