Issue #{}: Title representing the change (should be less then 40 characters)

One or more paragraph explaining the reasons of the changes.  We
should not repeat the changes in the code since this is visible in the
code itself with 'git log -p' or 'git diff' commands.

Also, let others know if this commit changes the results in some way.
You can also refer to other issues using the '#' sign.

Wrap the text with 72 characters.
